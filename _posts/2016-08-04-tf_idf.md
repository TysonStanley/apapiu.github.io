title: Tf-Idf Ridge Model Selection using Pipelines in Sklearn
---

### Creating a pipeline to tune  tf-idf + ridge regularization parameters and select the best model for text based predictions.


I am going to dabble a bit into text mining in this post. The idea is very simple: we have a collection of documents (these could be emails, books or craiglist ads) and we are trying to build a model that predicts something when given a new document of the same provenance. To make this more concrete we will look at two examples: 

- predicting the salary offer for a job based on the description of the job listing 
- predicing whether a text message is spam. 

Along the way I will also explore how to build pipelines in python using sklearn and how to use tf-idf to transform the documents into numeric matrices. I am pretty new to all of this myself (mostly writing this up so I don't forget) so any suggestions and corrections are welcome!

Let's load the required python modules:


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder 


from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
% matplotlib inline
```

Let's start with the salary listing first. We are going to try to build a model that predicts the salary offer for a job based on the description of the job listing.


```python
train = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajschumacher/gadsdata/master/salary/train.csv")
```


```python
y = train.SalaryNormalized
```


```python
train.head(3)
```

Let's take a closer look at what a posting looks like:


```python
train.FullDescription[1]
```

We will just use the description and build a pipeline to predict the Normalized Salary. This is quite easy in sklearn using a pipeline. Basically we will create a bag of words then scale the columns using tf_idf. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Then we will fit a regularized linear model to the data. Regularization is key here since when using bi-grams we'll end up with over 400k features and only 10k training examples.


```python
estimators = [("tf_idf", TfidfVectorizer()), 
              ("ridge", linear_model.Ridge())]
model = Pipeline(estimators)
```

#### So we just plug in the raw descriptions and the tf_idf transforms it into a matrix that is then fitted by the ridge model.

### $$Description\longrightarrow X , y \longrightarrow model$$


```python
model.fit(train.FullDescription, y) 
```




    Pipeline(steps=[('tf_idf', TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='word', binary=False, decode_error='strict',
            dtype=<class 'numpy.int64'>, encoding='utf-8', input='content',
            lowercase=True, max_df=1.0, max_features=None, min_df=1,
            ngram_range=(1, 1), norm='l2', preprocessor=None, smooth_idf=True,
    ...it_intercept=True, max_iter=None,
       normalize=False, random_state=None, solver='auto', tol=0.001))])



Now both the tf_idf transform and the ridge regression have tuning parameters and the nice thing about the pipeline we just built is that we can tune all the parameters at once:


```python
params = {"ridge__alpha":[0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10], #regularization param
          "tf_idf__min_df": [1, 3, 10], #min count of words allowed
          "tf_idf__ngram_range": [(1,1), (1,2)], #1-grams or 2-grams
          "tf_idf__stop_words": [None, "english"]} #use stopwords or don't
```

How many different model must we run? Well since we're doing a grid search we can just multiply the possibilities for each parameter to get `5*3*2*2` for a total of 60 models - a decent number. And keep in mind that for each model we have to build the tf_idf vectorizer all over again.


```python
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid = params, scoring = "mean_squared_error")
```

grid.fit(train.FullDescription, y)


```python
grid.best_params_
```




    {'ridge__alpha': 0.3,
     'tf_idf__min_df': 1,
     'tf_idf__ngram_range': (1, 2),
     'tf_idf__stop_words': 'english'}




```python
np.sqrt(-grid.best_score_)
```




    10532.473521325306



We can also look at all the params:


```python
params = pd.DataFrame([i[0] for i in grid.grid_scores_])
results = pd.DataFrame(grid.grid_scores_)
results = pd.concat([params, results], 1)
results["rmse"] = np.sqrt(-results.mean_validation_score)
```


```python
results.head(3)
```

### Examining the Best Model:


```python
model = grid.best_estimator_
```

Every time we predict the model will run the tf-idf part first, already fitted on the train set and then use the ridge regression model. 



```python
model.predict(train.FullDescription)
```




    array([ 25975.84531928,  32824.5058169 ,  32127.26976225, ...,
            50386.2916183 ,  50138.40072399,  27588.69246637])



One issue with using the pipeline is that we don't see the little details that go into fitting the models.

What if we want to examing more closely what goes on in each model? Say for example I want to look at the coefficients of my linear regression. That's also pretty straighforward using the `named_steps` method.


```python
grid.best_estimator_.named_steps["ridge"].coef_
```




    array([ -465.8824938 ,  1697.39286267,  1304.56896049, ...,  1416.89223231,
            -596.29992468,  -596.29992468])




```python
ridge_model = model.named_steps["ridge"]
tf_idf_model = model.named_steps["tf_idf"]
```


```python
coefficients = pd.DataFrame({"names":tf_idf_model.get_feature_names(),
                             "coef":ridge_model.coef_})
```

Let's look at the tokens with the largest coefficients:


```python
coefficients.sort_values("coef", ascending=False).head(10)
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

We see some of the usual suspects - such as london, consultant, director and manager. However given how many features we have (over 400k) it's hard to interpret these coefficients very accurately. Perhaps doing a Lasso model with a strong $l_1$ regularization might help with that, since that wil reduce the number of non-zero coefficients.

# Spam example:
Now let's look at another classical text analysis problem - clasifying wether an email (or text message) is spam or not. Let's load up the data:


```python
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv'
sms = pd.read_table(url, header=None, names=['label', 'message'])
```


```python
sms.head()
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>label</th>
      <th>message</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>ham</td>
      <td>Go until jurong point, crazy.. Available only ...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>ham</td>
      <td>Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>spam</td>
      <td>Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup fina...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>ham</td>
      <td>U dun say so early hor... U c already then say...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>ham</td>
      <td>Nah I don't think he goes to usf, he lives aro...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



And let's look at one example:


```python
sms.iloc[12, 1]
```




    'URGENT! You have won a 1 week FREE membership in our £100,000 Prize Jackpot! Txt the word: CLAIM to No: 81010 T&C www.dbuk.net LCCLTD POBOX 4403LDNW1A7RW18'



Ok this one is clearly spam :)


```python
corp = sms.message
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(sms.label) 
```

Notice that in this case we are prediting a class - ham vs. spam so linear regression won't cut it. 
So do we need to go thru the whole process of building the pipeline again? Well not really. The tf-idf part stays the same we just have to use logistic (instead of linear) regression. So we simply replace `linear_model.Ridge()` with `linear_model.RidgeClassifier()`.


```python
estimators = [("tf_idf", TfidfVectorizer()), 
              ("ridge", linear_model.RidgeClassifier())]
model = Pipeline(estimators)
```


```python
params = {"ridge__alpha":[0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10], #regularization param
          "tf_idf__min_df": [1, 3, 10], #min count of words allowed
          "tf_idf__ngram_range": [(1,1), (1,2)], #1-grams or 2-grams
          "tf_idf__stop_words": [None, "english"],#use stopwords or don't
          "tf_idf__use_idf":[True, False]}  #whether to scale columns or just leave normalized bag of words.
```


```python
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid = params)
```


```python
grid.fit(corp, y)
```




    GridSearchCV(cv=None, error_score='raise',
           estimator=Pipeline(steps=[('tf_idf', TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='word', binary=False, decode_error='strict',
            dtype=<class 'numpy.int64'>, encoding='utf-8', input='content',
            lowercase=True, max_df=1.0, max_features=None, min_df=1,
            ngram_range=(1, 1), norm='l2', preprocessor=None, smooth_idf=True,
    ...True,
            max_iter=None, normalize=False, random_state=None, solver='auto',
            tol=0.001))]),
           fit_params={}, iid=True, n_jobs=1,
           param_grid={'ridge__alpha': [0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10], 'tf_idf__stop_words': [None, 'english'], 'tf_idf__min_df': [1, 3, 10], 'tf_idf__ngram_range': [(1, 1), (1, 2)], 'tf_idf__use_idf': [True, False]},
           pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, scoring=None, verbose=0)

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Let's look at the regularization parameter alpha. Remember alpha is the inverse of C - so the smaller the alpha the stronger the regularization will be.


```python
results.groupby(["ridge__alpha"])["mean_validation_score"].aggregate([np.mean])
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>mean</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ridge__alpha</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0.1</th>
      <td>0.981545</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>0.3</th>
      <td>0.982434</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1.0</th>
      <td>0.981485</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3.0</th>
      <td>0.977267</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10.0</th>
      <td>0.954467</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



So we see that the best results are when alpha is small, around  0.1 - 0.3. If we make alpha too large we get a significant decrease in accuracy.

Note that in this case I tuned where the model should use idf or only tf. The best model does use idf but let's see if we look across all the tuning settings:


```python
results.groupby(["tf_idf__use_idf"])["mean_validation_score"].aggregate([np.mean, np.std])
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>mean</th>
      <th>std</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>tf_idf__use_idf</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>False</th>
      <td>0.976038</td>
      <td>0.009895</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>True</th>
      <td>0.974841</td>
      <td>0.014802</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Hmm interestingly not using idf performs slightly better over the entire grid space we tried out. This might be because the sms messages aren't very long. Here's a quote from the sklearn documentation on tf-idf: While the tf–idf normalization is often very useful, there might be cases where the binary occurrence markers might offer better features. Very short texts are likely to have noisy tf–idf values while the binary occurrence info is more stable.


```python

```
