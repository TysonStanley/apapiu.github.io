title: "Patterns in the Republican Primaries"
---

I am going to focus on the Republican Primaries in early states, plot some maps and graphs and see if I can figure out any patterns in the ways people voted. Hopefully I will update this as more results start pouring in. I also try to build some prediction models using county demographics and the votes so far. I posted this originally on kaggle scripts (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/apapiu/d/benhamner/2016-us-election/trends-in-the-republican-primary) for the code) so I am actually going to paste the html file below.
