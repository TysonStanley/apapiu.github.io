title: "Patterns in the Republican Primaries"
---

I am going to focus on the Republican Primary in Iowa, plot some maps and graphs and see if I can figure out any patterns in the ways Iowans voted. Hopefully I will update this as more results start pouring in. I will also try to build a prediction mode before Super Tuesday.
