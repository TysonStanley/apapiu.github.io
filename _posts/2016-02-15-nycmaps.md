title: "Interactive Maps of NYC: Biking, Ancestry and Dating"
---

I've been playing with the ACS census data in New York City and made some maps that will hopefully reveal some interesting facets of the city . Instead of looking at the usual suspects like median income or density I'm going to try to show New York from slightly different perspectives. Here's three of them.

I'll eventually write more on how I made them (basically using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [tigris](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/index.html) in R). For now you can look at the (poorly documented) code for the maps on Github [here](https://github.com/apapiu/Maps).

- The Singles Map was heavily inspired by Jonathan Soma's excellent map [here](http://visualizing.nyc/nyc-zip-codes-singles-map/). The only twist is that I look at _college educated_ singles and in this case the gap is even wider since less young men attend college than young women.
