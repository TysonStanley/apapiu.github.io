title: "Interactive Maps of NYC: Biking and Ancestry"
---

The tigris and leaflet packages in R allow us to build really cool interactive maps. Here I explore the census data and see if I can extract any cool information from it. We will be looking at differebt maps at different zoom levels.  I will make more comments and obersvations later on but for now just look at the maps and see what you c. Aren't they cool? I might write a tutorial on mapping with leaflet and tigris - it's actually not that hard and you get a great deal of flexibility in making these maps whichever way you want!
