title: "Interactive Maps of NYC: Biking, Ancestry and Dating"
---

I explore the ACS census data in New York City and make some maps that will hopefully show some interesting facets of the city . Instead of Looking at the usual suspects like median income or density I'm going to try to show New York from a slightly different perspectives. Here I give you three such perspectives. 

I will write more on how I made them (basically using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [tigris](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/index.html) in R) and what one could make of them. But for now I am having too much fun just looking at them.
