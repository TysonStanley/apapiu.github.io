title: "Interactive Maps of NYC: Biking and Ancestry"
---

The tigris and leaflet packages in R allow us to build really cool interactive maps. Here I explore the ACS census data in New York City. Instead of Looking at the usual suspects like median income or density I'm going to try to show New York from a slightly different perspective. Here I give you three such perspectives. I will make more comments on these maps soon but for now just looking at them will suffice. 

Click on an area to get more info. Enjoy!
