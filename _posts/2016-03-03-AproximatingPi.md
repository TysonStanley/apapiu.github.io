title: A Shiny App in honor of Pi
---
With March 14 looming on the horizon I decided to make a little Shiny app that lets us aproximate Pi by randomly 
generating points in a square. I really enjoyed making it and playing around with it. Simple interactive apps like these
have so much potential as teaching tools, hopefully we'll see more of them in math and science classrooms.
