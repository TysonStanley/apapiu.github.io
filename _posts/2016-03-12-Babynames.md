title: Gender Neutral Baby Names
---


Gender neutral names are names that tend to be given to both girls and boys. I will be looking at this interesting subset of names and try to answer some questions:

1. What have historically been the most gender neutral baby names?
2. How do these names behave over time?

The data for the analysis below comes from the Social Secutiy Administration. You can find the data [here](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/).
