Hello and welcome to my blog! My name's Alex and I'm doing a PhD in math at Washington University in St. Louis. My research focuses on problems in discrete geometry, combinatorics and graph theory. 

I have become quite intersted in machine learning and data visualization and have started this blog as a way to document my journey into the nebulous world of "data science". I am especially interested in using interactive visualizations to facilitate better understanding of complex datasets and of complex processes in math and machine learning.

I do most of the analysis you see in:  

- R (tidyr/dplyr/data.table %>% ggplot2/htmlwidgets %<>% caret %>% Rmarkdown/Shiny) 
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn in jupyter)
- SageMath (for pure math stuff)
- I've also been dabbling in D3.js for interactive visualizations, we'll see how that goes

I also try to keep my blog posts as reproducible as possible. You check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/apapiu?tab=repositories).

I have also been known to ride bikes, eat tacos, take [photos](http://alexpapiu.tumblr.com), play music, and think about urbanism.

If you have any questions comments or suggestions shot me an email or say hi on [twitter](https://twitter.com/apapiu) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apapiu). The various way to contact me are at the bottom of the page. 

Thanks for stopping by!
