Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm doing a PhD in math at Washington University in St. Louis. My  [research](http://www.math.wustl.edu/~apapiu/) focuses on problems in discrete geometry, combinatorics and graph theory. I have become quite intersted in machine learning and data visualization and have started this blog as a way to document my journey in the neblous world of data science.

When I am not doing math or playing around with data I like to ride my bike, eat tacos, take [photos](http://alexpapiu.tumblr.com) and think about urbanism.

If you have any questions comments or suggestions shot me an email or talk to me on twitter. The various way to contact me are at the bottom of the page. 

Thanks for stopping by!
