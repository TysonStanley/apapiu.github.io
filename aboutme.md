Hello and welcome to my blog! My name's Alex and I'm doing a PhD in math at Washington University in St. Louis. My research focuses on problems in discrete geometry, combinatorics and graph theory. 

I have become quite intersted in machine learning and data visualization and have started this blog as a way to document my journey into the nebulous world of "data science". 

I do most of the analysis you see in:    
- R (`tidyr %>% dplyr/data.table %>% ggplot/htmlwidets %<>% caret %>% Rmarkdown/Shiny`) 
- Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn` in jupyter)
- SageMath (for pure math stuff)

I also try to keep my blog posts as reproducible as possible. You check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/apapiu?tab=repositories).

When I am not doing math or playing around with data I like to ride my bike, eat tacos, take [photos](http://alexpapiu.tumblr.com), play music, and think about urbanism.

If you have any questions comments or suggestions shot me an email or say hi on twitter. The various way to contact me are at the bottom of the page. 

Thanks for stopping by!
