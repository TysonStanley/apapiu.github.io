Hey I'm Alex and I'm a mathematician doing [research](http://www.math.wustl.edu/~apapiu/) in discrete geometry, combinatorics and graph theory. I have become quite intersted in machine learning and data visualization and have started this blog as a way to document my journey in the neblous world of data science.

When I am not doing math or playing around with data I like to ride my bike, eat tacos, take [photos](http://alexpapiu.tumblr.com) and think about urbanism.
